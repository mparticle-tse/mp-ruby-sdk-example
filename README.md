# MP Ruby SDK Example
This repo contains a simple Ruby file that when ran (```ruby ruby-mp-sdk.rb```) sends a commerce, custom, and session events. You can see more methods [here](https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/server/ruby/)

# Pre reqs
 
 You will need Ruby to run the file. Ruby is already included in a default macOS installation but if you want to run a different version you can do so with RVM. More information [here](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/library/walkthroughs/deploy/ruby/ownserver/nginx/oss/install_language_runtime.html)

# Getting Started
